Deep learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages, and making decisions. Deep learning AI is able to learn without human supervision, drawing from data that is both unstructured and unlabeled.

Deep learning is a key technology behind many advanced AI applications, notably in the field of machine learning where software algorithms use large amounts of data to train themselves and improve their accuracy over time without human intervention. This process involves training artificial neural networks on a large set of labeled data and algorithms that allow them to acquire the ability to perform tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, and prediction capabilities.

At the heart of deep learning is the neural network architecture. Neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the brain and are designed to replicate its ability to detect patterns and interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, or clustering. The layers of a neural network consist of interconnected nodes, akin to neurons, with each layer designed to recognize an increasing level of abstraction of the input data.

These networks can learn and make intelligent decisions on their own, which makes them a crucial component of any AI endeavor. Deep learning models require a substantial amount of data to train effectively and are particularly powerful tools when it comes to processing and making decisions about complex, high-dimensional data such as images, sound, and text.
