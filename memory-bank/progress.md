# Project Progress

## Completed Work
- Initial **text processing pipeline** (`pipeline_testo_completa.ipynb`)
- **LanceDB** storage setup (`lesson_chunks.lance`)
- Memory bank documentation established and updated
- Initial review of text pipeline outputs and cleaned speech text
- Implemented **recursive hierarchical summarization pipeline** with metadata
- Integrated **hierarchical mode toggle** and parameters in Streamlit app
- Enhanced **logging** of chunk and batch summaries
- Improved **database explorer** with hierarchy filters and search
- Fixed **Streamlit page config error**
- Added **auto-creation** of MCQ and flashcard tables on startup and button press
- Improved **LanceDB reconnection** logic during flashcard generation

## In Progress
- Refining **text cleaning** and processing workflows
- Developing **benchmark comparison** methods
- Designing **report generation** (PDFs, structured data)
- Finalizing UI polish and error handling
- Improving metadata enrichment and filtering
- Further stabilizing LanceDB table creation and connection handling

## Remaining Work
1. Complete and document text processing workflow
2. Develop comprehensive benchmarks for content analysis
3. Implement reporting system for outputs
4. Add visualization of hierarchical summary tree (optional)
5. Consider Anki export options
6. Improve robustness of flashcard/MCQ generation from DB

## Known Issues
- Flashcard table sometimes not available despite auto-creation attempts
- Pipeline quality requires further evaluation
- Storage schema may need refinement based on evolving needs
- Benchmark criteria and report formats to be defined

## Evolution
- Started with text processing focus
- Added hierarchical summarization capabilities
- Moving toward integrated analysis, benchmarking, and reporting
- Improving UI flexibility and robustness
- **Audio processing is currently out of scope**
