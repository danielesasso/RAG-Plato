# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
- Jupyter notebook-based pipelines
- Modular processing steps
- LanceDB for structured storage
- PDF/benchmark output generation

## Key Components
1. **Text Processing Pipeline**
   - Input: Raw text files
   - Output: Cleaned, structured data

2. **Audio Processing Pipeline** 
   - Input: Audio files
   - Output: Transcribed text

3. **Data Storage**
   - LanceDB for vector storage
   - Organized by lesson chunks

4. **Analysis & Reporting**
   - Benchmark comparisons
   - PDF report generation

## Design Patterns
- Notebook-based workflows
- Modular pipeline steps
- Batch processing
- Data versioning through LanceDB
